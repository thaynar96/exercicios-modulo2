            <p>I'm currently studying at BlueEdtech and I've got a lot of plans. This is a personal project I started
                after few lessons of CSS. I hope you enjoy!</p>

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I've worked as an English teacher in Brazil for over 4 years. The experience of communicating with others and making a difference in their lives was amazing. In the year of 2021 I've decided to focus on programming. I'd had contact with technology since I was little and this world of development got me. I've been creating websites with CSS, HTML and JavaScript. If you're looking for a hardworking person that is commited to working and studying for many hours, send me a message and I'll do my best to level up your company's value.</p>

                    <p>The first project I did as a student. I had to create files in Html, Css and JavaScript. The main goul of the project was to change the face expressions to demonstrate the humor of the character.</p>

                    <p>The second project was developed as personal one.I've used Html and Css. The idea was to create a responsive website with as many sections as possible, so I could practice. </p>

                    <p>The third project is also a personal one. I've created instagram's homepage. I've only used CSS flexbox and media queries to make it responsive.</p>
